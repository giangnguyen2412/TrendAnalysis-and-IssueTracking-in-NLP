South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday dismissed reports that President Moon Jae-in has asked Pope Francis to help arrange a summit with North Korea's reclusive leader, also noting it was not the time for such a meeting.A local newspaper reported that the South Korean president sought to ask for the pope's help in arranging an inter-Korean summit in his letter to the head of the Vatican. This file photo, taken on March 11, 2017, shows then presidential hopeful of the liberal Democratic Party Moon Jae-in (L) shaking hands with Archbishop Kim Hee-joong in Gwangju, 350 kilometers south of Seoul. Following his inauguration as the new South Korean president, Moon named Archbishop Kim as his special envoy to the Vatican. (Yonhap)The newspaper quoted Archbishop Hyginus Kim Hee-joong, Moon's special envoy to the Vatican, for the report, noting the archbishop was expected to meet the pontiff later Tuesday or Wednesday."Archbishop Kim is in fact set to deliver the president's personal letter to the pope. However, the letter does not contain a request to the pope to help mediate a South-North Korean summit," Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said in a released statement.The president has instead only asked the pontiff to pray for peace and reconciliation between the two Koreas, he added.Such a quick rejection of a possible summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un follows a series of missile launches by Pyongyang.The North launched what it claimed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Hwasong-12, on May 14, only four days after the South Korean leader came into office following his victory in a presidential by-election.The communist state again test-fired a medium-range missile, the Pukguksong-2, on Sunday.Moon has repeatedly vowed to use all available means, including dialogue, to rid North Korea of its nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.However, the continued provocations from North Korea have apparently forced the new liberal South Korean government to stick to sticks, at least for now."We will sternly deal with any provocation. It is also important to enhance our defense capability to deter and prevent North Korea's additional provocations," Chung Eui-yong, head of the National Security Office and Moon's top security adviser, told reporters Monday.Chung also stressed a need to resume dialogue with the North eventually but noted talks with the communist state must not "undermine the international framework of sanctions against the North."Seoul and Pyongyang have held two rounds of inter-Korean summits: in 2000 and 2007.The two Koreas technically remain at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. (Yonhap) North Korea on Wednesday called on South Korea to take actions to ease military tensions along the inter-Korean border ahead of the 17th anniversary of a historic summit between the two Koreas.North Korea's agency in charge of inter-Korean relations also described President Moon Jae-in's dual-track approach of seeking dialogue and sanctions as a "foolish act and self-deception." (Yonhap)"(South Korea) should go into action to remove the danger of armed conflicts in land, sea and sky, including the areas of the Military Demarcation Line, and defuse the military tensions," the Committee for Peaceful Reunification said in English.The agency stressed that South Korea should not cling to reckless military provocations to defend what it calls the illegal and bogus de facto western sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line.The North has long demanded that the line be drawn farther south. The two Koreas' naval forces fought bloody battles in 1999, 2002 and 2009 near the border.The North's call came as Thursday marks the anniversary of the first inter-Korean summit between former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il held in 2000.Liberal President Moon Jae-in took office May 10 with pledges to seek North Korea's denuclearization while pursuing engagement and dialogue with Pyongyang.But North Korea has criticized Moon for joining the US-led drive to apply sanctions and pressure against Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.Pyongyang has also turned down South Korean civic groups' move to resume exchanges in protest of Seoul's support of the latest UN sanctions against the North. (Yonhap) South Korea on Thursday urged North Korea to seek reconciliation and peace as the two rivals marked the 17th anniversary of their first summit.On June 15, 2000, leaders of South and North Korea held a historic summit in Pyongyang, which produced a landmark joint declaration on reconciliation. This file photo taken by the Joint Press Corp. on June 13, 2000, shows former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung (right) and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il shaking hands at an airport in Pyongyang as the two Koreas hold their first inter-Korean summit. (Yonhap)Seoul's unification ministry said that a spirit of reconciliation expressed in the declaration takes on a significance for the current grave inter-Korean ties."By respecting and implementing the joint declaration, the two Koreas should carry out a spirit of seeking peace on the Korean Peninsula and inter-Korean reconciliation," the ministry said.The anniversary came amid heightened tensions sparked by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Liberal President Moon Jae-in proclaimed a dual-track approach of pressure and engagement.But North Korea called Moon's policy a "foolish act and self-deception," urging the South to ditch what it called confrontational policies, including Seoul's 2010 unilateral sanctions.It has turned down South Korean civic groups' move for inter-Korean exchanges in protest of Seoul's support of the latest UN sanctions against Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests.North Korea's agency in charge of inter-Korean ties Wednesday called on South Korea to take actions to ease military tensions along the border. (Yonhap) A North Korean-led taekwondo organization will participate in a world taekwondo championship in South Korea opening Saturday, amid the Moon Jae-in administration seeking “sports diplomacy” to repair its relationship with North Korea. A 36-person delegation of the North Korean-led International Taekwondo Federation will arrive in Seoul by plane via Beijing on Friday and is scheduled to stay until July 1, the ITF and the South Korea’s Ministry of Unification said Thursday. The delegation includes a total of 32 North Korean nationals, including current ITF chief Ri Young-sun and Chang Ung, the only North Korean member of the International Olympic Committee and a former ITF chief, and 12 North Korean athletes.The 2017 World Taekwondo Federation World Taekwondo Championship is to run from Saturday to Friday in Muju, some 240 kilometers south of Seoul in North Jeolla Province.This undated photo provided by the World Taekwondo Federation shows a taekwondo demonstration team of the North Korea-lead International Taekwondo Federation. (Yonhap)The first inter-Korean taekwondo exchange in nearly a decade, the visit comes as President Moon is openly expressing hopes to re-engage the North with diplomacy and dialogue, amid Pyongyang’s relentless pursuit of nuclear and missile programs.“To resolve the issue we have to add dialogue to the current menu of sanctions and pressure,” Moon said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.The Moon administration is also drawing up plans for a possible inter-Korean sports team for the upcoming 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics to paint the event as the “Peace Olympics.” “There are plans to talk with the IOC to create an inter-Korean women’s hockey team,” Do Jong-hwan, South Korea’s new sports minister, said Tuesday. “Hopefully, we‘ll be able to thaw lingering tensions as we try to bring North Korea on board.” Do also added that Thomas Bach, president of the IOC and who is scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the taekwondo championship, has plans to meet Moon on July 3, upon the president’s arrival from Seoul-Washington bilateral summit. The meeting is expected to be an opportunity for Moon to roll out his ideas for the Peace Olympics. President Moon himself also expressed hopes for the two Koreas to collaborate in the bidding process to host the 2030 World Cup. “If the neighboring countries in Northeast Asia, including North and South Korea, can host the World Cup together, it would help to create peace in North and South Korea as well as Northeast Asia,” Moon said earlier this month, according to the president’s spokesperson Park Su-hyun. The upcoming taekwondo event is expected to be the largest world championship of the sport, indigenous to Korea, to date, with a record number of 971 athletes from 183 nations registered to compete. South Korea’s Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung will attend the event with the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism overseeing the tournament, according to a Ministry of Unification official Thursday. Demonstration teams from each federation will hold a joint performance choreographed for the tournament’s opening ceremony, marking the first time it is being showcased in South Korea. The WTF, headquartered in Seoul, is a control tower for taekwondo worldwide with the IOC’s support. The ITF, although sanctioned by the North Korean regime, is headquartered in Vienna. By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com) South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday invited North Korea to the Winter Olympic Games to be held in the country early next year, while welcoming a North Korean delegation to the World Taekwondo Championships."I believe in the strength of sports that has been establishing peace. I am glad to see the first sports exchange of the South and the North under the new (South Korean) government take place at this event," Moon said in his congratulatory speech marking the opening of the event hosted by the World Taekwondo Federation.The new South Korean president was speaking before 971 athletes and 796 officials from 183 countries, making the seven-day biennial event in Muju, located 240 kilometers south of Seoul, the largest of its kind ever to be held.

(Yonhap)The participants included a 36-member delegation, including 32 North Koreans, from the North Korea-led International Taekwondo Federation, with a 12-member demonstration team also set to stage its first-ever performance in South Korea."It will mark the first time the ITF will perform at a WTF event held in South Korea," the president said."Friendship and goodwill exchanges between the two federations will of course greatly contribute to reconciliation between South and North Korea, as well as the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula," he added, noting the WTF was set to send a demonstration team to an ITF event to be held in Pyongyang in September."I wish the achievement made by taekwondo will be repeated at the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games next year. If a North Korean delegation takes part in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, I believe it will greatly contribute to realizing the Olympic values of friendship and peace," President Moon said, according to a script of his remarks released by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae in Seoul.Also present at the opening of the taekwondo championships in Muju were Chang Ung, North Korea's sole member of the International Olympic Committee, and Ri Yong-son, the North Korean head of the ITF.President Moon especially extended his welcome to the two, noting their journey to South Korea must have been the longest. Before his speech, Moon shook hands with Chang and exchanged a few words with him.South Korea and North Korea remain divided and technically at war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended only with an armistice and not a peace treaty.Earlier this week, Seoul's new sports minister, Do Jong-hwan, suggested forming a joint Korean team in women's hockey and holding skiing events at North Korea's Masikryong resort during PyeongChang 2018.The ideas may well get some traction, as IOC President Thomas Bach is scheduled to visit Muju for the WTF championships' closing ceremony next Friday. During his stay, Bach is expected to discuss the issue with relevant parties.In his speech, Moon said he'd once again like to feel the emotions from watching the joint march of the two Koreas in the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Moon also made references to the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships and the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship, two competitions where the Koreas fielded joint teams.After the Sydney Games, the two Koreas also had joint marches at the 2002 Busan Asian Games, 2003 Aomori Asian Winter Games, 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, 2006 Torino Winter Olympics, 2006 Doha Asian Games and 2007 Changchun Asian Winter Games.For a joint march in PyeongChang to materialize, North Korea must first qualify to compete in the Olympics. North Korea didn't participate in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. For PyeongChang, the North's last shot is in pairs figure skating, and its skaters' fate will be determined in September. (Yonhap) North Korea detained two South Korean citizens Friday on espionage charges, in a move that could worsen already-frosty inter-Korean relations.North Korean authorities announced Kim Guk-gi and Choi Choon-gil were detained for spying on the North. The South denied the accusations and demanded their immediate release. “We strongly ask that (the North) release our citizens without delay,” a spokesperson for the South’s Unification Ministry said. “We express deep regret over the North’s ridiculous claims.”Kim Guk-gi (left) and Choi Choon-gil, two South Koreans, appear at a press conference Thursday in Pyongyang. North Korea has detained them on espionage charges. (Yonhap)But the South’s efforts to free them will be an uphill battle, analysts said, given the North’s record on detaining U.S. and South Korean citizens for months on similar grounds, despite external pressure to release them. Later Friday, the North refused to accept a letter from Seoul officials requesting their release.The Unification Ministry also requested for Kim Jong-uk, another South Korean citizen, to be released. He has been detained in North Korea since October 2013.Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, was detained in the North for nearly two years from 2012 to late last year. Laura Ling and Euna Lee, two U.S. reporters, were also detained in 2009.The North asserted that Kim and Choi were found to have relayed information on the North to the South’s National Intelligence Service. Pyongyang authorities added the two had attained information from Chinese residents near the North Korean border in Manchuria.Kim and Choi admitted their charges at a press conference held in the North. Many in the South believe the conference was staged and the confessions made under duress.“Their lives probably depended on it,” said Ahn Chan-il, a North Korea expert.Ahn added that Kim and Choi were likely detained so the North could gain an upper hand over the South in any future negotiations.“For South Korea to gain (Kim and Choi’s release), it will be forced to appease the North in some way,” he said.“The North might ask that the South lift sanctions imposed on the North in return for someone’s release,” Ahn added, in reference to the so-called May 24 sanctions the South put on the North in 2010 after Pyongyang torpedoed a southern naval ship, the Cheonan, in March of that year.There has been debate in Seoul’s legislature in recent weeks over whether it should lift the May 24 sanctions in order to improve worsening ties with the North. But most South Korean conservatives have opposed removing the sanctions, saying the North must first apologize for its sinking of the Cheonan. North Korea has consistently denied involvement in the sinking, sparking anger with both liberal and conservative South Koreans.By Jeong Hunny (hj257@heraldcorp.com) North Korea on Sunday urged South Korea to shift its inter-Korean policy as it called on Seoul to reject the United States' drive for sanctions and seek national unity.South Korea has turned a deaf ear to North Korea's call for inter-Korean reconciliation and unity while jumping on the bandwagon of Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the North's main newspaper. (Yonhap)"We should completely block the influence of outside forces, which have brought division to us," the newspaper said in its commentary.The article comes as newly elected President Moon Jae-in is taking a dual-track approach toward denuclearizing, with an emphasis being placed not only on guarding against further provocations but finding middle ground through inter-Korean dialogue and civilian exchanges.But Pyongyang has rejected South Korean civic groups' move to resume exchanges, dampening Moon's efforts. North Korea called on Seoul to implement the two inter-Korean summit declarations on reconciliation before it seeks civilian inter-Korean exchanges.On June 15, 2000, then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il held a historic summit in Pyongyang. It produced a landmark agreement on inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.The North's paper said in a separate commentary that the South is wrong to allow civilian inter-Korean exchanges while employing pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang."South Korea's current government is following in the footsteps of its (conservative) predecessor by saying it will fully implement the international sanctions," it claimed. (Yonhap) MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has told a South Korean presidential envoy that he is willing to mediate between South and North Korea by dispatching his emissary to Pyongyang in a bid to help relieve tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Song Young-gil, a special envoy of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, quoted Putin as saying, in their Wednesday meeting, "I am willing," in response to his question asking whether he could send an emissary to Pyongyang to learn of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's intention and the country's internal situation. (Yonhap)"The North Korean nuclear issue could never be resolved through war. That's impossible," Song also quoted Putin as saying during their 45-minute meeting in Moscow. "The problem should be solved through dialogue because using sanctions alone has limitations, and it could also work against North Korean people and incur humanitarian issues."The president also stressed the need to resume the forum of the six concerned countries, known as the six-party talks, to negotiate ways to deal with the North Korean issue as well as the need to open direct talks between North Korea and the United States.Putin said he will hold a phone conversation with US President Donald Trump to talk him into resuming dialogue with Kim Jong-un, according to Song, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party.Touching on South Korea's staging of the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, Putin reiterated Russia's opposition."The THAAD system has limits in its effectiveness to fend against North Korea's long-range artillery. ... The problem of (North Korean nuclear and missile development) cannot be resolved by military responses only," Putin was also quoted as saying. Also discussed in the meeting were several trilateral economic cooperation projects involving the two Koreas and Russia, which were suspended in early 2016 following North Korea's nuclear tests and missile provocations. They include the trilateral logistics project aimed to link the three countries' sea ports to transport Russian coal to South Korea via North Korea. Putin expressed intentions to resume those economic projects, stressing that such joint work could help resolve tensions on the peninsula. They shared the understanding that South Korea needs to make efforts to pursue trilateral economic projects and agreed to discuss the issue further during a future summit between Moon and Putin.A free trade agreement between South Korea and the Russia-led regional block, the Eurasian Economic Union, and a bilateral project to jointly develop Arctic shipping routes were also suggested during the meeting, according to Song. Moon and Putin are set to meet in July on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Germany. Putin expressed his expectations for the summit and invited Moon to the Eastern Economic Forum that Russia is to host on Sept. 6-7.Song conveyed Moon's handwritten letter to Putin and Moon's messages indicating that he is eager to step up bilateral relations with Russia.With the meeting with Putin, Song wrapped up his Russian trip and plans to head back to Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap) President Park Geun-hye urged North Korea Wednesday to embrace reform and openness amid a rare sign of thaw on the divided Korean Peninsula."I hope that North Korea will build a future for co-prosperity and development by opening its doors and choosing the path of change," Park said in a ceremony in Cheorwon, a county near the border with North Korea.The ceremony is designed to break ground for the restoration of the South's section of a disconnected inter-Korean railroad that once linked central Seoul to the North Korean eastern city of Wonsan.South Korea hopes to reconnect the inter-Korean rail before linking it to Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway, an ambitious project that will cut shipping times and logistics costs for South Korea's Europe-bound exports.Discussions on the project to connect the Trans-Siberian Railway with the potential Trans-Korean Railway have been under way for more than a decade, although no major progress has been made due to geopolitical obstacles, particularly North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.Park said South Korea will seek cooperation with the United States, China and Russia over her "Eurasia Initiative" aimed at linking energy and logistics infrastructure across Asia and Europe."The doors of opportunity stand open for North Korea to join in this process," Park said.She also called on North Korea to trust South Korea and join forces for inter-Korean reconciliation.North Korea has so far ignored repeated international calls to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and emulate such countries as Vietnam and Myanmar.Instead, North Korea has vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy against it.Park's latest appeal came as former South Korean first lady Lee Hee-ho arrived in North Korea for a rare trip.It was not immediately clear whether Lee could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The trip is seen as a sign of thaw between the two Koreas. In July, the North threatened to cancel the trip, citing South Korea's alleged provocations.Lee is the widow of former President Kim Dae-jung, who held the first inter-Korean summit with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, the late father of current leader Kim Jong-un, in 2000. (Yonhap) South and North Korea were to resume rare high-level talks Sunday aimed at resolving the ongoing military crisis, with both sides maintaining full combat readiness along the border.The Koreas had nightlong negotiations at the truce village of Panmunjom through early Sunday morning on "how to resolve the situation that was recently created, and how to improve inter-Korean relations," South Korea's presidential spokesman Min Kyung-wook told reporters.The South's National Security Adviser Kim Kwan-jin plans to meet Hwang Pyong-so, the top political officer of the North's military, there again at 3 p.m. Sunday, he added. Hong Yong-pyo, Seoul's point man on Pyongyang, and his northern counterpart, Kim Yang-gon, will join.The hourslong pause in the talks is intended to "review each other's position," Min said.The North remained at what it called a "semi-war state," readying its 76.2-millimeter artillery near the border, according to military officials here.The South also continued anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts from about a dozen border areas. On Thursday, North Korea gave a 48-hour ultimatum that the South remove all loudspeakers and stop the broadcast campaign, threatening to launch "a strong military action" otherwise. North Korea also warned Friday that it is prepared to engage in an "all-out war." (Yonhap)But experts here were cautiously optimistic of the results of the negotiations."I think the outlook is not that bad. At least a deal between South and North Korea can be reached to reduce military tensions," said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor at Dongguk University."(Inter-Korean) contact this time is meaningful in that it is cooling tension for a moment."Kim Young-soo, a professor at Sogang University, said the two sides have effectively ended the latest standoff by holding a high-profile meeting."If one side uses fire, it will be fully to blame," he said.Propaganda broadcasts have become a bone of contention between the two Koreas after South Korea resumed them earlier this month for the first time in 11 years.South Korea took the measure in retaliation against North Korea for a recent land mine attack that maimed two South Korean soldiers. South Korea accused the North of planting the mines inside the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas, a charge denied by North Korea.North Korea views the psychological warfare critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as an insult to its dignity. The isolated country is also concerned that an influx of outside information could pose a threat to Kim.Tension between the Koreas has risen further since Thursday's exchange of artillery fire.The North fired one artillery shell across the border in the afternoon before firing several more rounds later in apparent anger over South Korea's resumption of the broadcasts. South Korea fired back dozens of shells.The North later claimed it didn't start Thursday's exchange of fire with the South and accused Seoul of fabricating the allegations that the communist nation fired first.
