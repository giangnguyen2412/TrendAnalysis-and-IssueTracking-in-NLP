South Korea's presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Tuesday dismissed reports that President Moon Jae-in has asked Pope Francis to help arrange a summit with North Korea's reclusive leader, also noting it was not the time for such a meeting.A local newspaper reported that the South Korean president sought to ask for the pope's help in arranging an inter-Korean summit in his letter to the head of the Vatican.

However, the letter does not contain a request to the pope to help mediate a South-North Korean summit," Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Soo-hyun said in a released statement.The president has instead only asked the pontiff to pray for peace and reconciliation between the two Koreas, he added.Such a quick rejection of a possible summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un follows a series of missile launches by Pyongyang.The North launched what it claimed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Hwasong-12, on May 14, only four days after the South Korean leader came into office following his victory in a presidential by-election.The communist state again test-fired a medium-range missile, the Pukguksong-2, on Sunday.Moon has repeatedly vowed to use all available means, including dialogue, to rid North Korea of its nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.However, the continued provocations from North Korea have apparently forced the new liberal South Korean government to stick to sticks, at least for now."We will sternly deal with any provocation.

hope that North Korea will build a future for co-prosperity and development by opening its doors and choosing the path of change," Park said in a ceremony in Cheorwon, a county near the border with North Korea.The ceremony is designed to break ground for the restoration of the South's section of a disconnected inter-Korean railroad that once linked central Seoul to the North Korean eastern city of Wonsan.South Korea hopes to reconnect the inter-Korean rail before linking it to Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway, an ambitious project that will cut shipping times and logistics costs for South Korea's Europe-bound exports.Discussions on the project to connect the Trans-Siberian Railway with the potential Trans-Korean Railway have been under way for more than a decade, although no major progress has been made due to geopolitical obstacles, particularly North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.Park said South Korea will seek cooperation with the United States, China and Russia over her "Eurasia Initiative" aimed at linking energy and logistics infrastructure across Asia and Europe."The

doors of opportunity stand open for North Korea to join in this process," Park said.She also called on North Korea to trust South Korea and join forces for inter-Korean reconciliation.North Korea has so far ignored repeated international calls to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and emulate such countries as Vietnam and Myanmar.Instead, North Korea has vowed to develop its economy and nuclear arsenal in tandem, viewing its nuclear programs as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy against it.Park's latest appeal came as former South Korean first lady Lee Hee-ho arrived in North Korea for a rare trip.It was not immediately clear whether Lee could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.The trip is seen as a sign of thaw between the two Koreas.
