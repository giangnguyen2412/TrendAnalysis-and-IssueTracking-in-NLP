\section{Conclusion and Future Work} 
We recognized the popular implementations for stemming are still rule based. Not all the words can be stemmed to their right root word. With stemming, there is lot of ambiguity which may cause several false positives. Besides, with k-means clustering, determining the number of clusters in a data set is time-consuming, and the correct choice of k is often ambiguous. In addition, although giving state-of-the-art result compared with existing tools, OLLIE requires much extra effort for pre-formatting and post-processing. The more structured input are, the more accurate output could be achieved. Name Entity Recognition tools like Spacy easily produce errors because of no deep understanding about entities. In our opinion, applying Nature Language Understanding (NLU) for NER tools would enhance accuracy. When trend analysis could be addressed by combining tools, there is no issue tracking model available because this task is domain-specific and far more complicated regardless of pervasion of data from media.
Ultimately, evaluation is nearly the most important part when constructing a new model, but it is underrated at first. As future work, a comprehensive and appropriate testbed should be built and applied to assess the performance of the new model.
