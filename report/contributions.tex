\section{Contributions}
In our weekly team meetings we always set weekly goals and tried to distribute the tasks evenly. However, we sometimes had other assignments and delayed our weekly goals for one week. For this reason we didn't fully succeed to distribute the work evenly.

All team-members agreed on the following overall work distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Giang: 45 \% Text Preprocessing, Open Information Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, Code Structure and Documentation
\item Lydia: 35 \% Feature Selection, Dependency Tracking, Visualization
\item Phillip: 20 \% Clustering
\end{itemize}
